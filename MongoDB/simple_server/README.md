<h2>Motivation</h2>
Simple node.js which access mongeDB

<h2>Points of interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>MongoDb instance is remote and hosted by mlab as a service</li>
<li>URL to db , db admin user name and db admin password are stored on dev.js which is .gitignore so it will not appear to everyone in github</li>
</ul>

<h2>package installation</h2>
npm install mongodb
