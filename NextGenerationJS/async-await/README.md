<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>async problem and solution via async\await</li>
<li>the user is asked to input num1 followed by asking the user to input num2 , once this is done they are added and written to the console</li>
<li>The user input is accessed by means of a callback</li>
</ul>


<h2>Problem</h2>
node async_problem.js

<h2>Solution</h2>
node async_await.js

<h2>Points of interest</h2>
<ul>
<li>node is used but async operations exist also on the client side</li>
<li>The solution can be implemented without async\await using just promise but this requires promise chaining</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Node should be installed on your machine

<h2>Todo</h2>
async_await.js works even when GetNum is not marked async, so why do i need it
